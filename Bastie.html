              obber knights once roamed the area long ago. Then the Romantic
              artists came. Today, the Bastei Rock is a popular sight. From the
              Bastei look-out point a unique panoramic view opens up to many
              landmarks including the Lilienstein Mountain and Königstein
              Fortress. A 76.5 m long bridge stretches between the rock
              formations. You can also enjoy a fantastic view from the Bastei
              Bridge in the Elbe Sandstone Mountains. Across the bridge you
              reach the well-known remains of Felsenburg Neurathen Rock Fort. It
              is the largest medieval fort of the area. Other impressive viewing
              points such as Ferdinandstein or Kanapee Cliff provide spectacular
              wide views over the Elbe Valley and to the Elbe Sandstone
              Mountains.The access road to Bastei Rock and to the Bastei
              Berghotel MountainHotel leads via the small village of Lohmen.
              Simply enter the address 01847 Lohmen into your navigation system
              or the GPS coordinates: Latitude 50.9665139 and Longitude
              14.0657333. At the approach to Bastei there are two options to
              park your car. There is a car park in the immediate vicinity of
              Bastei Rock. From there, even wheelchair users can comfortably
              start their excursion to Bastei Rock. Another car park is situated
              at the outset of Basteistraße Road; there is the option to use a
              bus shuttle service to Bastei Rock.A visit to the Bastei can be
              integrated perfectly into a day tour through Saxon Switzerland.
              There are many hiking routes that lead around Bastei Rock. A very
              popular hike runs from Stadt Wehlen via Bastei to Kurort Rathen
              (or the other way round). On this hiking tour, also called the
              “Golden Triangle”, sights such as the ruins of Wehlen Fort, Bastei
              Bridge and the Schwedenlöcher (Swede Hole) Trail can be
              discovered.

              The best way to travel to Bastie is by taking a flight from one of
              hubs into a major Swiss city like dresden or munich. From Dresden,
              take the S-bahn to Rathen (Dresden Hbf to Kurort Rathen, 33 – 46
              minutes, multiple trains per day). Once in Rathen, take the ferry
              across the Elbe River (visit the Kurort-Rathen website for more
              information). From Rathen there are hiking trails that take you up
              to the Bastei

              have to follow the signs (or the other hikers) and hike all the
              way up to Bastei Bridge. You will see the famous rock formations
              from the bottom. The hike will take about 30-45 minutes
