            <p>
              For the uninitiated, Ladakh is a region located in the state of
              Jammu and Kashmir, India. The city lies on the Leh-Srinagar
              highway and is little more than 400 km from Srinagar, the summer
              capital of Jammu and Kashmir. Irrespective of where you come from
              or whatever faith you practice, Ladakh provides something for
              everyone.Tourists love this place all year round. Unarguably, one
              of the most beautiful places on Earth, Ladakh, located in the
              northern reaches of India, is a place ripe with sights to delight
              and nature to astound you. A number of tourist destinations cannot
              be missed in your Leh and Ladakh tourism guideâ€”Tso Moriri, Nubra
              Valley, Pangong Tso, Siachen Glacier, Shanti Stupa. These places
              in Leh and Ladakh tour packages make tourism one of the most
              beautiful experiences. The magnificent mountains and mesmerising
              lakes will take your breath away. This beautiful region has a
              diverse topography: lush green valleys and glacial lakes, rustic
              villages, and astounding Gompas. It lets you escape your busy life
              and is the perfect destination to rejuvenate yourself. Along with
              the natural beauties, Ladakh tourism offers a rich cultural
              experience. The people, the culture, and the environment all blend
              into a harmony that gives you a rich experience. The climate of
              Ladakh varies according to region and season. In general, the
              months between July and September are considered summer months,
              when the weather is pleasant in the entire region. One of the most
              sought-after tourist destinations, the crown jewel of northern
              India, largely unexplored and undiscovered, Ladakh is a magical
              experience for any tourist.

              India is a very budget friendly place to travel, with hostels
              available from $3 and private rooms starting from $6, but this is
              one place in Asia where you get what you pay for. Meals are also
              cheap, costing about $1 to $5 depending on location.
              Transportation in India is generally by tuk-tuk or car, but the
              train is better for long distance trips. Short distance trips can
              be done with the Uber transportation app.
