            For the uninitiated, Ladakh is a region located in the state of
            Jammu and Kashmir, India. The city lies on the Leh-Srinagar highway
            and is little more than 400 km from Srinagar, the summer capital of
            Jammu and Kashmir. Irrespective of where you come from or whatever
            faith you practice, Ladakh provides something for everyone.Tourists
            love this place all year round. Unarguably, one of the most
            beautiful places on Earth, Ladakh, located in the northern reaches
            of India, is a place ripe with sights to delight and nature to
            astound you. A number of tourist destinations cannot be missed in
            your Leh and Ladakh tourism guideâ€”Tso Moriri, Nubra Valley, Pangong
            Tso, Siachen Glacier, Shanti Stupa. These places in Leh and Ladakh
